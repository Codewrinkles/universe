# Codewrinkles Universe

> **Building in public**: A modern ecosystem of interconnected apps for content creators and learners.

---

## What is this?

Codewrinkles Universe is a unified platform that rethinks how we create, share, and consume content. Instead of isolated apps competing for attention through algorithmic manipulation, we're building an ecosystem where apps work together to provide genuine value.

### The Apps

**Pulse** - Microblogging, redefined
- Your followers actually see your posts (chronological feed, no algorithm)
- Discover new voices through genuine social proof, not virality metrics
- Built for meaningful conversations, not engagement farming

**Nova** - Learning, reimagined *(coming soon)*
- AI-powered learning companion
- Chat-first interface for exploring topics
- Personalized learning paths that adapt to you

**More to come** - The ecosystem is just getting started

---

## Why build this?

Modern platforms optimize for engagement, not value. Followers don't see your content. Algorithms promote whatever triggers emotional responses. Quality content gets buried under viral noise.

We're building something different:
- **Pulse** respects the follow relationship - if someone follows you, they see your content
- **Nova** surfaces knowledge based on relevance, not clickbait
- **The ecosystem** connects apps to create compounding value

## Building in Public

This is an experiment in transparent product development. I'm documenting the journey of building a startup as a CTO, sharing lessons about:
- Product architecture decisions
- Technical implementation
- Community building
- Balancing vision with pragmatism

## Current Status

🚧 **In Development** - Phase 1: Account & Identity System

We're building the foundation:
- User authentication and profiles
- Unified identity across all apps
- Core infrastructure

Check [core.md](./core.md) for the product vision and roadmap.
